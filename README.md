##### This is a website for displaying and managing articles with the ability to create new account and log in. It offers two main user scenarios. Unlogged-in users can view articles by topic and can search for articles by title. Successfully logged in users can create new articles in addition to viewing and searching functions. Newly created articles will be displayed on the home page under the relevant topic, and successfully logged in users can access their own personal page to view, edit or delete existing articles created by that user.
